# To Do List application

Built using React and Redux, with axios and thunks.  Uses the https://github.com/adbario/todo-api API, built using Laravel.

This application and API were built by Riku Sarkinen and Deanna Marbeck using pair programming, in the last week of the DevelopMe bootcamp.

The application allows a user to add tasks to a task list, edit tasks, and delete tasks.  Tasks can be marked as complete, and also reverted to active. 

Tasks are listed in separate lists for active and completed tasks.
